# AirBalloonGame
This game takes place in the sky and is about collecting balloons. After hitting enter to start the game, the player uses the arrow keys to move the
hot air balloon to collect the balloons that are rising from the bottom randomly. However, the player also has to look out for blue birds that are 
also rising randomly from the bottom and are moving faster than the blue balloons. If the birds collide with the air balloon, the game is over. The
objective of the game is to see how many balloons the player can collect in 45 seconds. Have fun!
